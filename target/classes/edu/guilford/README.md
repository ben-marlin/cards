# Building a Card Game

Previously, we built a dice roller, which could be adapted to any number of dice games. Another common type of game is based on a card deck. In this project we'll do the following.

- Create a Card class 
- Create a Deck class for poker containing Cards
- Make the Deck shuffle to randomize the cards
- Deal a card from a particular position
- Deal a card from the "top" of the deck

To do this, you'll need to understand what's going on with creating a class (and all the necessary methods), instantiating a class, using objects. To that end, it would be a huge advantage to have read Chapter 11 before starting on this project.

## Sample Code

You have been given sample code that should print the Unicode characters for hearts, spades, diamonds, and clubs. Run it! If you don't get the appropriate symbols, we have to do something with your machine!

If all else fails, we'll just use H for hearts, S for spades, D for diamonds, and C for clubs. But the actual symbols would look cool.
